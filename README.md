## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need [Python](https://python.org) 3.7 or later to run this script. Below are some extra things you need to download / install too:

- **[GClone](https://github.com/donwa/gclone)** - Run the shell / batch script if you are on Linux to install, or add the `gclone.exe` file to your system PATH variables if you are on Windows. Putting the script in the same directory as GClone in Windows will work as well. If you are on MacOS, download the Darwin build of GClone.
- **[AutoRClone](https://github.com/xyou365/autorclone)** - GClone requires service accounts. To generate and manage them, use AutoRClone. You can then configure GClone using the service accounts.
- **Pip requirements** - In the folder of this GitHub Repository, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and wait for the Python requirements are finished installing
- **[Docker (OPTIONAL)](https://docker.com) & [Docker-Compose (OPTIONAL)](https://docs.docker.com/compose)** - If you want to run the bot in a containerized Docker environment, you have to install Docker and Docker-Compose first. You can use Heroku too! **THIS IS OPTIONAL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE DOCKER OR HEROKU!**
- **[Git (OPTIONAL)](https://git-scm.com)** - You can use this tool to contribute to development of CloneCord or by cloning the repo for your own use.

## How to run the bot

1. Download the repository as a zip file and extract it (Click on the green `Code` button on the front page of this GitHub repo and then click `Download Zip`). Make sure to keep the xtracted folder in a directory which can be easily accessed. An alternative way is to use Git to `git clone https://github.com/rekulous/clonecord-bot` and get the repo.
2. Go to the [Discord Application Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and then create a new application.
3. Turn the application into a bot and copy its token. **NEVER SHARE THIS WITH ANYBODY, IT IS THE WAY THE PYTHON SCRIPT GAINS ACCESS TO THE BOT!!!**
<!-- Pretty sure that you setup the config either in environment variables or in the .env file but whatever -->
4. Append the bot token to `TOKEN` value in the configuration file `(.env)`. After that, setup the bot prefix (e.g ?, !, etc.). 
5. Open up a Terminal (on Windows namely Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell) and then `cd` (enter) into the directory of the extracted folder from before.
6. Run `python3 CloneCord.py`. The output of the Terminal or Command Line should have no errors and show that everything is all ready!

**Enjoy using CloneCord!**

## Docker

1. Follow the first five steps of [How to run the bot](#How-to-run-the-bot)
2. Feel free to edit `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` to your preferences and desire if you want
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` and wait for docker-compose to build the container and Docker image
4. Run `docker conatainer ls` and `docker image ls` to check if the CloneCord container and image is running

**If the image and container exists, and the container is running, CloneCord is working! Check to see if your bot is working and enjoy!**
